- start fitting JS into framework

- to carry on:
-need to redo the message box - append it to screen ONCE, then whenever I need to show a get it's content via Ajax, append it to the box, show the box. Also set up listeners for any buttons within the box at this point also. Then when message is no longer needed, fadeOut the box.
